For both R Scripts, simply open the files with RStudio and run the functions inside in the order below.

## R Scripts {-}
1. `gdp_etl_pipeline.R` Contains one function which runs the entire ETL pipeline.
2. `gdp_etl_plots.R` Contains one function which generates comparison plots for all individual economies and groups of economies. The plots are exported to a pdf file.

## Working Directory {-}
The scripts automatically set the working directory to the location of the active R script file in RStudio.

## Directories {-}
Defines paths for:

- `datadir`: Data input
- `outputdir`: Output files

## Economy Metadata {-}
Files found in `datadir`:

- `Dim_countries.csv`: Contains economy codes and valid year ranges.
- `Dim_Countries_Hierarchy_All.csv`: Contains hierarchical grouping for aggregations.
- `lab_all.csv`: Contains economy codes and labels.
- `GDP growth rates.xlsx`: Contains growth rates for all economies. (needed only when estimating values for the last year)
- `US.GDPTotal_20250718_104458.csv` Last release of GDP dataset at [UNCTADstat](https://unctadstat.unctad.org/datacentre/dataviewer/US.GDPTotal)

## Output Files {-}
Files found in `outputdir`:

- `gdp_comparison.csv`: A dataset containing old and new GDP values.
- `GDP_comparison_groups.pdf`: Comparison plots of all individual economies and groups of economies.
- `gdp_update.csv`: An updated dataset in a generic format.
- `gdp_update_usis.csv`: An updated dataset in a specific format to be used by USIS for uploading to UNCTADstat.
