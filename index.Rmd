# About {-}

This R script performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on GDP data sourced from the UN Statistics Division. It handles preprocessing, data aggregation for regions/groups and creates comparison plots. The pipeline process can be broken down into 3 steps:

1.  Data is **extracted** from [UNSD](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/swagger/index.html) and [Taiwan NSO](https://nstatdb.dgbas.gov.tw/dgbasall/webMain.aspx?k=engmain) using their API.
2.  Afterwards, the data is **transformed** such that is meets UNCTAD requirements.
3.  Lastly, the data is **loaded** into a csv file which can be uploaded to [UNCTADstat Data centre](https://unctadstat.unctad.org/datacentre/).

## Gross Domestic Product {-}
GDP at **current prices** (or **nominal** GDP) measures the value of goods and services produced in an economy using the prices of the same year, so it includes the effects of inflation. In contrast, GDP at **constant prices** (or **real** GDP) adjusts for inflation by using prices from a base year (2015), reflecting only the actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced. This makes real GDP a better measure of economic growth over time.
